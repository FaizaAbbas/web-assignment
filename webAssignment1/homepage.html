<h2>Introduction to our Mobile Application</h2>
<p>Our project is to build an android based application to integrate SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) on a single platform.
 We have targeted sports industries of Sialkot. These SMEs are facing three major problems which are as follows:
<ul>	
<li>Lack of learning orientation</li>
<li>Lack of market orientation</li>
<li>Lack of innovativeness</li></ul><br />
This platform will provide the learning through GBL (Game based Learning), 
and solve these problems through this technique.
Another focus of our application is CRM (Customer Relation Management) 
in which the investors are facing. This platform will recommend the required SMEs,
 to investors using the CBR (Case Based Reasoning), CBR is a technique used to recommend things by using past
 experiences and data for decision making and problem solving . CBR will recommend the things to the customer this will enhance the customer relation. 
 This platform will analyze performances of different SMEs and compare them with each other.
